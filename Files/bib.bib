  abstract = {This paper presents a new methodology to accurately characterize and predict the annual variation of wind conditions. The estimate of the distribution of wind conditions is necessary to quantify the available energy (power density) at a site, and to design optimal wind farm configurations. A smooth multivariate wind distribution model is developed to capture the coupled variation of wind speed, wind direction, and air density. The wind distribution model developed in this paper avoids the limiting assumption of unimodality of the distribution. This method, which we call the Multivariate and Multimodal Wind Distribution (MMWD) model, is an evolution from existing wind distribution modeling techniques. Multivariate kernel density estimation, a standard non-parametric approach to estimate the probability density function of random variables, is adopted for this purpose. The MMWD technique is successfully applied to model (i) the distribution of wind speed (univariate); (ii) the joint distribution of wind speed and wind direction (bivariate); and (iii) the joint distribution of wind speed, wind direction, and air density (multivariate). The latter is a novel contribution of this paper, while the former offers opportunities for validation. Both onshore and offshore wind distributions are estimated using the MMWD model. Recorded wind data, obtained from the North Dakota Agricultural Weather Network (NDAWN) and the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC), is used in this paper. The coupled distribution was found to be multimodal. A strong correlation among the wind condition parameters was also observed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {A very flexible joint probability density function of wind speed and direction is presented in this paper for use in wind energy analysis. A method that enables angular-linear distributions to be obtained with specified marginal distributions has been used for this purpose. For the marginal distribution of wind speed we use a singly truncated from below Normal-Weibull mixture distribution. The marginal distribution of wind direction comprises a finite mixture of von Mises distributions. The proposed model is applied in this paper to wind direction and wind speed hourly data recorded at several weather stations located in the Canary Islands (Spain). The suitability of the distributions is judged from the coefficient of determination R The conclusions reached are that the joint distribution proposed in this paper: (a) can represent unimodal, bimodal and bitangential wind speed frequency distributions, (b) takes into account the frequency Of null winds, (c) represents the wind direction regimes in zones with several modes or prevailing wind directions, (d) takes into account the correlation between wind speeds and its directions. It can therefore be used in several tasks involved in the evaluation process of the wind resources available at a potential site. We also conclude that, in the case of the Canary Islands, the proposed model provides better fits in all the cases analysed than those obtained with the models used in the specialised literature on wind energy.

  abstract = {This thesis contains a comprehensive 3D Navier-Stokes computational study of the characteristics of wakes of wind turbines operating in various flow conditions including interacting wakes between a row of turbines. The computations were carried out using the actuator line technique combined with the 3D Navier Stokes solver EllipSys3D and a LES turbulence model. Simple models, based on applying body forces in the computational domain, are developed for imposing sheared and turbulent infow and their validity is discussed. A few computations on stand alone turbines are compared to measurements and good to fair agreement are shown in terms of respectively power coefficient and mean wake properties. The turbulence properties in the wake are generally characterized by its spectral characteristics and include estimation of spectral coherence, length scales and Reynolds stresses. Simulations of the wake from an isolated turbine operating in uniform inflow at tip-speed ratios ranging from λ = 3.21 to λ = 11.78 is presented and provides detailed information about the wake development including vortex properties and turbulence characteristics. Calculations on the wake of turbines subject to sheared inflow shows that besides an expected vertical skewed wake the wake also becomes increasingly asymmetric in the horizontal direction as it is convected downstream. The latter phenomena, which is also often observed in measurements, is argued to be caused by the rotation of the wake. A detailed study is presented to investigate the influence of including turbulence in the inflow. The study shows that the ambient turbulence causes the vortex system in the wake to become unstable much closer to the rotor and as a consequence the wake becomes fully turbulent earlier than if inflow turbulence is neglected. Furthermore, it is shown that the main effect governing the large scale meandering of wakes is the large scale structures of the ambient turbulence field. Finally studies are conducted on rows of respectively two and three turbines.The investigation includes evaluation of the loading on the rotors and it is shown that the turbines are subject to rather severe yaw moments, even in situations where the mean wind is oriented along the row. This observation is indicative of large scale dynamics of the wakes.}

  abstract = {In this paper, single wake characteristics have been studied both experimentally and numerically. Firstly, the wake is studied experimentally using full-scale measurements from an adapted focused pulsed lidar system, which potentially gives more insight into the wake dynamics as compared to classical studies based on meteorological (met) masts and continuous wave lidar measurements, due to its capability of scanning several cross sections simultaneously. A wake center tracking procedure is used to estimate the sideways wake center displacements, also referred to as lateral meandering of the wake, and it is compared to the predictions from the Dynamic Wake Meandering model, for a selected 10 minutes dataset. Secondly, the average wake expansion in the fixed frame of reference is determined from measurements and compared to results from CFD simulations. The CFD simulations were conducted using the EllipSys3D flow solver using Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and Actuator Line Technique (ACL) to model the rotor. Discrepancies due to the uncertainties on the wake advection velocity are observed and discussed.}

abstract = {We present an idealized simple, but fast, semi-analytical algorithm for computation of stationary wind farm wind fields with a possible potential within a multi-fidelity optimization. strategy for wind farm topology Basically, the model considers wakes as linear perturbations on the ambient non-uniform mean wind field, although the modelling of the individual stationary wake flow fields includes non-linear terms. The simulation of the individual wake contributions are based on an analytical solution of the thin shear layer approximation of the NS equations. The wake flow fields are assumed rotationally symmetric, and the rotor inflow fields are consistently assumed uniform. Expansion of stationary wake fields is believed to be significantly affected by meandering of wake deficits as e.g. described by the Dynamic Wake Meandering model. In the present context, this effect is approximately accounted for by imposing suitable empirical downstream boundary conditions on the wake expansion that depend on the rotor thrust and the ambient turbulence conditions, respectively. For downstream distances beyond approximately 10 rotor diameters (at which distance the calibrated wake expansion boundary conditions are imposed), the present formulation of wake expansion is believed to underestimate wake expansion, because the analytical wake formulation dictates the wake expansion to behave as x1/3 expansion as primary develops approximately with downstream distance, whereas wake controlled by wake meandering linearly with the downstream distance. The link from a non-uniform wind farm wind field, consisting of linear perturbations on the ambient non-uniform mean wind field, to a fictitious uniform wake generating inflow field is established using two different averaging approaches – a linear and a non-linear. With each of these approached, a parabolic system are described, which is initiated by first considering the most upwind located turbines and subsequently successively solved in the downstream direction. Algorithms for the resulting wind farm flow fields are proposed, and it is shown that in the limit of very large downstream distances, the simulated field is shown to recover to the undisturbed ambient wind field upstream the wind farm.},

abstract = {This report describes the development of a fast and reasonably accurate model for the prediction of energy production in o shore wind farms taking wake effects into account. The model has been implemented as a windows application called Fuga which can run in batch mode or as a graphical user interface. Fuga is briefly described. The model is based on alinearization technique which is described in some detail, and linearized, governing equations are derived and written in a standard form based on a mixed-spectral formulation. A new solution method is used to solve the equations which involves intensive use of look-up tables for storage of intermediate results. Due to the linearity of the model, multiple wakes from many turbines can be constructed from the wake of a single, solitary turbine. These are in turn constructed from Fourier components by a fast Fourier integral transform of results derived from generic look-up tables. Three different models, based on three different closures, are examined: the 'simple closure' using an unpertubed eddy viscosity ku*z the mixing length closure the E-$\epsilon$ closure Model results are evaluated against o shore wind farm production data from Horns Rev I and the Nysted wind farm, and a comparison with direct wake measurements in an onshore turbine (Nibe B) is also made. A very satisfactory agreement with data is found for the simple closure. The exception is the near wake, just behind the rotor, where all three linearized models fail. The mixing length closure underestimates wake e ects in all cases. The E-$\epsilon$ closure overestimates wake losses in the o shore farms while it predicts a too shallow and too wide the wake in the onshore case. The simple closure performs distinctly better than the other two. Wind speed data from the the Horns rev met masts are used to further validate Fuga results with the 'simple' closure. Finally, R\o dsand 1 and 2 are used as an example to illustrate the interaction between wind farms.},

@article{VanOijen2005,
abstract = {Process-based forest models generally have many parameters, multiple outputs of interest and a small underlying empirical database. These characteristics hamper parameterization. Bayesian calibration offers a solution to the calibration problem because it applies to models of any type or size. It provides parameter estimates, with measures of uncertainty and correlation among the parameters. The procedure begins by quantifying the uncertainty about parameter values in the form of a prior probability distribution. Then data on the output variables are used to update the parameter distribution by means of Bayes' Theorem. This yields a posterior calibrated distribution for the parameters, which can be summarized in the form of a mean vector and variance matrix. The predictive uncertainty of the model can be quantified by running it with different parameter settings, sampled from the posterior distribution. In a further step, one may evaluate the posterior probability of the model itself (rather than that of the parameters) and compare that against the probability of other models, to aid in model selection or improvement. Bayesian calibration of process-based models cannot be performed analytically, so the posterior parameter distribution must be approximated in the form of a representative sample of parameter values. This can be achieved by means of Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation, which is suitable for process-based models because of its simplicity and because it does not require advance knowledge of the shape of the posterior distribution. Despite the suitability of Bayesian calibration, the technique has rarely been used in forestry research. We introduce the method, using the example of a typical forest model. Further, we show that reductions in parameter uncertainty, and thus in output uncertainty, can be effected by increasing the variety of data, increasing the accuracy of measurements and increasing the length of time series.},

abstract = {This thesis describes the different steps needed to design a steady-state computational fluid dynamics (CFD) wind farm wake model. The ultimate goal of the project was to design a tool that could analyze and extrapolate systematically wind farm measurements to generate wind maps in order to calibrate faster and simpler engineering wind farm wake models. The most attractive solution was the actuator disc method with the steady state k-$\epsilon$ turbulence model. The first step to design such a tool is the treatment of the forces. This thesis presents a computationally inexpensivemethod to apply discrete body forces into the finite-volume flow solver with collocated variable treatment (EllipSys), which avoids the pressure-velocity decoupling issue. The second step is to distribute the body forces in the computational domain accordingly to rotor loading. This thesis presents a generic flexible method that associates any kind of shapes with the computational domain discretization. The special case of the actuator disc performs remarkably well in comparison with Conway's heavily loaded actuator disc analytical solution and a CFD full rotor computation, even with a coarse discretization. The third step is to model the atmospheric turbulence. The standard k-$\epsilon$ model is found to be unable to model at the same time the atmospheric turbulence and the actuator disc wake and performs badly in comparison with single wind turbine wake measurements. A comparison with a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) shows that the problem mainly comes from the assumptions of the eddy-viscosity concept, which are deeply invalidated in the wind turbine wake region. Different models that intent to correct the k-$\epsilon$ model's issues are investigated, of which none of them is found to be adequate. The mixing of the wake in the atmosphere is a deeply non-local phenomenon that is not handled correctly by an eddy-viscosity model such as k-$\epsilon$ .},

@article{Madsen2010,
abstract = {As the major part of new wind turbines are installed in clusters or wind farms, there is a strong need for reliable and accurate tools for predicting the increased loadings due to wake operation and the associated reduced power production. The dynamic wake meandering (DWM) model has been developed on this background, and the basic physical mechanisms in the wake—i.e., the velocity deficit, the meandering of the deficit, and the added turbulence—are modeled as simply as possible in order to make fast computations. In the present paper, the DWM model is presented in a version suitable for full integration in an aeroelastic model. Calibration and validation of the different parts of the model is carried out by comparisons with actuator disk and actuator line (ACL) computations as well as with inflow measurements on a full-scale 2 MW turbine. It is shown that the load generating part of the increased turbulence in the wake is due almost exclusively to meandering of the velocity deficit, which causes "apparent turbulence when measuring the flow in a fixed point in the wake. Added turbulence, originating mainly from breakdown of tip vortices and from the shear of the velocity deficit, has only a minor contribution to the total turbulence and with a small length scale in the range of 10–25\% of the ambient turbulence length scale. Comparisons of the calibrated DWM model with ACL results for different downstream positions and ambient turbulence levels show good correlation for both wake deficits and turbulence levels. Finally, added turbulence characteristics are compared with correlation results from literature.},

@article{Johnson2010,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Bayesian inference has the advantage of formally incorporating prior beliefs about the effect of an intervention into analyses of treatment effect through the use of prior probability distributions or "priors." Multiple methods to elicit beliefs from experts for inclusion in a Bayesian study have been used; however, the measurement properties of these methods have been infrequently evaluated. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the feasibility, validity, and reliability of a belief elicitation method for Bayesian priors.

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A single-center, cross-sectional study using a sample of academic specialists who treat pulmonary hypertension patients was conducted to test the feasibility, face and construct validity, and reliability of a belief elicitation method. Using this method, participants expressed the probability of 3-year survival with and without warfarin. Applying adhesive dots or "chips," each representing 5\% probability, in "bins" on a line, participants expressed their uncertainty and weight of belief about the effect of warfarin on 3-year survival.

RESULTS: Of the 12 participants, 11 (92\%) reported that the belief elicitation method had face validity, 10 (83\%) found the questions clear, and 11 (92\%) found the response option easy to use. The median time to completion was 10 minutes (5-15 minutes). Internal validity testing found moderate agreement (weighted kappa=0.54-0.57). The intraclass correlation coefficient for test-retest reliability was 0.93.

CONCLUSION: This method of belief elicitation for Bayesian priors is feasible, valid, and reliable. It can be considered for application in Bayesian clinical studies.},

abstract = {A wind farm layout optimization framework based on a multi-fidelity model approach is applied to the offshore test case of Middelgrunden, Denmark. While aesthetic considerations have heavily influenced the famous curved design of Middelgrunden wind farm, this work focuses on testing a method that optimizes the profit of offshore wind farms based on a balance of the energy production, the electrical grid costs, the foundations cost, and the wake induced lifetime fatigue of different wind turbine components. The multi-fidelity concept uses cost function models of increasing complexity (and decreasing speed) to accelerate the convergence to an optimum solution. In the EU TopFarm project, three levels of complexity are considered. The first level uses a simple stationary wind farm wake model to estimate the Annual Energy Production AEP, a foundations cost function based on the water depth, and an electrical grid cost function. The second level calculates the AEP and adds a wake induced fatigue cost function based on the interpolation of a database of simulations done for various wind speed and wake setups with the aero-elastic code HAWC2 and the Dynamic Wake Meandering (DWM) model. The third level includes directly the HAWC2 and DWM models in the optimization loop in order to estimate both the fatigue costs and the AEP. The novelty of this work is the implementation of the multi-fidelity, the inclusion of the fatigue costs in the optimization framework, and its application on an existing offshore wind farm test case.},

  abstract = {The accuracy and the computational efficiency of a Point-Collocation Non-Intrusive Polynomial Chaos (NIPC) method applied to stochastic problems with multiple uncertain input variables has been investigated. Two stochastic model problems with multiple uniform random variables were studied to determine the effect of different sampling methods (Random, Latin Hypercube, and Hammersley) for the selection of the collocation points. The effect of the number of collocation points on the accuracy of polynomial chaos expansions were also investigated. The results of the stochastic model problems show that all three sampling methods exhibit a similar performance in terms of the the accuracy and the computational efficiency of the chaos expansions. It has been observed that using a number of collocation points that is twice more than the minimum number required gives a better approximation to the statistics at each polynomial degree. This improvement can be related to the increase of the accuracy of the polynomial coefficients due to the use of more information in their calculation. The results of the stochastic model problems also indicate that for problems with multiple random variables, improving the accuracy of polynomial chaos coefficients in NIPC approaches may reduce the computational expense by achieving the same accuracy level with a lower order polynomial expansion. To demonstrate the application of Point-Collocation NIPC to an aerospace problem with multiple uncertain input variables, a stochastic computational aerodynamics problem which includes the numerical simulation of steady, inviscid, transonic flow over a three-dimensional wing with an uncertain free-stream Mach number and angle of attack has been studied. For this study, a 5th degree Point-Collocation NIPC expansion obtained with Hammersley sampling was capable of estimating the statistics at an accuracy level of 1000 Latin Hypercube Monte Carlo simulations with a significantly lower computational cost.}

  abstract = {Sensitivity analysis is often performed in connection with uncertainty analysis, the latter being the prime objective. In this context, the aim of sensitivity analysis is to identify the main contributors to model output uncertainty. Therefore the term "Uncertainty Importance Analysis" is sometimes used. In general, uncertainty analysis proceeds by Monte Carlo simulation. The affordable number of model runs is usually small for processor-time or computationally intensive models. This has consequences for the type of uncertainty statements needed. For efficiency reasons, sensitivity analysis cannot afford a separate specifically chosen set of model runs but has to use those that were performed for the purpose of uncertainty analysis. Since their number n is small and the number in of uncertainties is frequently large, correlation coefficients and standardized regression coefficients, the latter possibly obtained from stepwise regression, are a reasonable choice of sensitivity measures. Spurious correlation is inevitably present in the multivariate sample of size n and can often not be reduced or eliminated. The correlation ratio is an indispensable sensitivity measure, whenever model uncertainty is expressed by more than two model alternatives or when measures, quantifying degrees of linear or monotone relationship, are not adequate. As a consequence of the small sample size, the correlation ratio is affordable only in approximate form. Results from analyses of applications of computationally intensive models serve as examples. The last section presents a practical example intended to illustrate the outstanding role played by uncertainty and sensitivity analysis in the quality assurance of the computer model and of its application.

The uncertainty associated with the wind flow model can make up a significant part of the overall energy yield uncertainty. In the present work, a systematic method for estimating wind flow modelling uncertainty is presented. The method is easy to implement with basic energy yield variables and is applicable to industry standard wind flow models such as WAsP and MS3DJH. The equations used are empirical fits to real wind flow model errors obtained by analysing historical data from over 500 mast pairs.}

Ground-based remote sensing of winds is relevant, in particular, for new large wind turbines where meteorological masts do not enable observations across the rotor-plane, i.e., at 100 to 200 m above ground level. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and sound detection and ranging (SoDAR) offer capabilities to observe winds at high heights. Airborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) used for ocean wind mapping provides the basis for detailed offshore wind farm wake studies and is highly useful for development of new wind retrieval algorithms from C-, L-, and X-band data. Satellite observations from SAR and scatterometer are used in offshore wind resource estimation. SAR has the advantage of covering the coastal zone where most offshore wind farms are located. The number of samples from scatterometer is relatively high and the scatterometer-based estimate on wind resources appears to agree well with coastal offshore meteorological observations in the North Sea. Finally, passive microwave ocean winds have been used to index the potential offshore wind power production, and the results compare well with observed power production (mainly land-based) covering nearly two decades for the Danish area.},

Whether modelling the wind in the coastal zone or further offshore, the physical modelling should reliably describe the wind speed profiles over water, including the influence of the surface roughness length and atmospheric stability. The modelling outputs required and analysed here are: mean wind speed (Vave) and Weibull parameters (A, k), reference wind speed (Vref) and characteristic turbulence intensity (I15). WAsP and WAsP Engineering modelling results are compared to measurements at offshore met. masts, as well as onshore data sets and other modelling results. The available meteorological input data may be observations from ships or lighthouses, measurements from offshore masts, wind atlas data sets, NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data, and data}

The analysis was performed in the context of observed variability on time scales longer than a year. The findings are discussed in the context of the ability to predict the long-term wind energy potential reliably both for wind farms as well as small turbines. In the analysis, some measures are defined to quantify the forecast accuracy and the long-term prediction error. One of the items of discussion was motivated by the observation in the wind industry that the year 2010 was a poor year, with hopes that it was just an exceptional year and fears that it might be an indicator of continuing climate change. The result of this discussion is that 2010 can only be seen as an outlier if one assumes that the past decades represent a constant wind climate. A linear regression, however, suggests that this assumption may not be correct and that 2010 may have been a low-wind year but consistent with generally observed fluctuations around a changing wind climate.

  abstract = {The construction of an offshore demonstration wind farm was planned in a southwestern sea-area of the Korean Peninsula. To estimate economic feasibility and to establish a reliable design basis, it is necessary to identify the design parameters of the demo-farm. For a reliable estimation of the design parameters, the first offshore meteorological mast, HeMOSU (Herald of the Meteorological and Oceanographic Special Research Unit), was constructed at the site of the demo-farm. In addition, supplementary meteorological masts were installed in advance at Gochang and Wangdeung-do in order to enhance the estimation of the long-term wind potential for the demo-farm. In this paper, assessments of wind energy potential are carried out with the data measured from these three meteorological masts. The analysis includes seasonal and diurnal changes in wind speed and surface roughness as well as wind/energy rose. Long-term wind potential is also estimated by using MCP (Measure-Correlate-Predict) techniques to clarify the design basis and to determine the wind turbine class in accordance with IEC 61400. The AEP (Annual Energy Production), as well as the C.F. (Capacity Factor) of the candidate site are evaluated with the estimated design parameters. Crown Copyright (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {In this work we consider a general notion of distributional sensitivity, which measures the variation in solutions of a given physical/mathematical system with respect to the variation of probability distribution of the inputs. This is distinctively different from the classical sensitivity analysis, which studies the changes of solutions with respect to the values of the inputs. The general idea is measurement of sensitivity of outputs with respect to probability distributions, which is a well-studied concept in related disciplines. We adapt these ideas to present a quantitative framework in the context of uncertainty quantification for measuring such a kind of sensitivity and a set of efficient algorithms to approximate the distributional sensitivity numerically. A remarkable feature of the algorithms is that they do not incur additional computational effort in addition to a one-time stochastic solver. Therefore, an accurate stochastic computation with respect to a prior input distribution is needed only once, and the ensuing distributional sensitivity computation for different input distributions is a post-processing step. We prove that an accurate numerical model leads to accurate calculations of this sensitivity, which applies not just to slowly-converging Monte-Carlo estimates, but also to exponentially convergent spectral approximations. We provide computational examples to demonstrate the ease of applicability and verify the convergence claims.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Food-web models can be powerful tools to assess effects of chemicals on ecosystem structure and functioning. Indeed, they do not only account for direct ecotoxicological effects on aquatic species, but also consider the interactions between these species and the resulting indirect effects of chemicals. However, such models often contain a large number of parameters and are therefore difficult to calibrate on experimental data. Following this rationale, sensitivity analyses (SA) are essential tools that enable us to simplify the calibration process by identifying the non-influential input parameters which can be further fixed at a nominal value. In this study, the screening SA Morris method and the variance-based SA method EFAST were compared on two ecological food-web models (of 20 and 34 parameters). These sub-models represent two prey–predator chains, the first containing two outputs (periphyton and grazers) and the second one three outputs (green algae, rotifers and invertebrate predators). Both SA methods ranked the models’ parameters according to their influence on the outputs. Nevertheless, the Morris approach can a priori be sensitive to sampling design parameters that are (generally arbitrarily) chosen by the modeller. Therefore, we then tested different settings of this method, in particular the ‘level’ and ''sampling’ numbers of the design, as well as its aleatory component, and gave recommendations about the most accurate Morris sampling design. To test the accuracy of the Morris results, median ranks derived from this latter approach were compared to those obtained with EFAST. It was observed that Morris and EFAST approaches actually identified the same 8 and 15 non-influential parameters for the two sub-models. These parameters were mainly related to the mortality, respiration and excretion processes. None of the non-influential parameters were involved in the growth functions, expected to be the driving processes of the system.},

This is based on a measure of importance to calculate the fractional contribution of the input parameters to the variance of the model prediction. Measures of importance in sensitivity analysis have been suggested by several authors, whose work is reviewed in this article. More emphasis is given to the developments of sensitivity indices by the Russian mathematician I.M. Sobol'. Given that Sobol' treatment of the measure of importance is the most general, his formalism is employed throughout this paper where conceptual and computational improvements of the method are presented. The computational novelty of this study is the introduction of the 'total effect' parameter index. This index provides a measure of the total effect of a given parameter, including all the possible synergetic terms between that parameter and all the others. Rank transformation of the data is also introduced in order to increase the reproducibility of the method. These methods are tested on a few analytical and computer models. The main conclusion of this work is the identification of a sensitivity analysis methodology which is both flexible, accurate and informative, and which can be achieved at reasonable computational cost.

Based on applications in flood risk assessment and agro-ecology, we present current research to adapt the methods of variance-based SA to such models. After recalling the basic principles, we propose a metamodelling approach of dynamic models based on a reduced-basis approximation of PDEs and we show how the error on the subsequent sensitivity indices can be quantified. We then present a mix of pragmatic and methodological solutions to perform the SA of a dynamic agro-climatic model with non standard input factors. SA is then applied to a flood risk model with spatially distributed inputs and outputs. Block sensitivity indices are defined and a precise relationship between these indices and their support size is established. Finally, we show how the whole support landscape and its key features can be incorporated in the SA of a spatial model.},

The advantage of this approach is it is more easily applied to nonlinear problems than the methods presented earlier by Hills and Trucano (1999, 2001); the method is based on optimization for which software packages are readily available; and the method can more easily be extended to handle measurement uncertainty and prediction uncertainty with different probability structures. Several examples are presented utilizing this metric. We show conditions under which this approach reduces to the approach developed previously by Hills and Trucano (2001). Secondly, we expand our earlier discussions (Hills and Trucano, 1999, 2001) on the impact of multivariate correlation and the effect of this on model validation metrics. We show that ignoring correlation in multivariate data can lead to misleading results, such as rejecting a good model when sufficient evidence to do so is not available.},

  abstract = {Model selection based on information theory is a relatively new paradigm in biological sciences with several advantages over the classical approaches. The aim of the present study was to apply information theory in the area of modelling fish growth and to show how model selection uncertainty may be taken into account when estimating growth parameters. The methodology was applied for length-age data of four species of fish, taken from the literature. Five-candidate models were fitted to each dataset: von Bertalanffy growth model (VBGM), generalized VBGM, Gompertz growth model, Schnute-Richards growth model, and logistic. In each case, the 'best' model was selected by minimizing the small-sample, bias-corrected form of the Akaike information criterion (AIC). To quantify the plausibility of each model, given the data and the set of five models, the 'Akaike weight' omega(i) of each model was calculated. The average model was estimated for each case based on wi. Following a multi-model inference (MMI) approach, the model-averaged asymptotic length L. for each species was estimated, using all five models, by model-averaging estimations of L. and weighting the prediction of each model by wi. In the examples of this study, model selection uncertainty caused a magnification of the standard error of the asymptotic length of the best model (up to 3.9 times) and thus in all four cases estimating L. from just the best model would have caused overestimation of precision of the asymptotic length. The VBGM, when used for inference, without being the best model, could cause biased point estimation and false evaluation of precision. Model selection uncertainty should not be ignored even if VBGM is the best model. Multi-model inference by model-averaging, based on Akaike weights, is recommended for making robust parameter estimations and for dealing with uncertainty in model selection. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The performance of Bayesian model selection and BMA has been studied.

There are several realistic simulation studies of the performance of BMA relative to other methods in a variety of situations, including linear regression (George and McCulloch 1993 and Raftery, Madigan and Hoeting 1997), log-linear models (Clyde 1999), logistic regression (Viallefont, Raftery and Richardson 2001) and wavelets (Clyde and George 2000). The BMA distribution of a quantity of interest can be viewed as the posterior distribution from the full model, with a mixed discrete-continuous prior distribution that assigns weight to the events that the individual components are zero. A simple normal example has been presented to assess numerical differences in performance and also of the extent to which results hold event if the prior distribution is not the same as the practical distribution. Posterior model probabilities can be computed in four ways.},

Models are usually combined using constant weights that do not distinguish between different regions of the covariate space. However, a procedure that performs well in a given situation may not do so in another situation. In this paper, we propose the concept of local Bayes factors, where we calculate the Bayes factors by restricting the models to regions of the covariate space. The covariate space is split in such a way that the relative model efficiencies of the various Bayesian models are about the same in the same region while differing in different regions. An algorithm for clustered Bayes averaging is then proposed for model combination, where local Bayes factors are used to guide the weighting of the Bayesian models. Simulations and real data studies show that clustered Bayesian averaging results in better predictive performance compared to a single Bayesian model or Bayesian model averaging where models are combined using the same weights over the entire covariate space.},

In order to illustrate the application of ideas of UA in a realistic scenario, there then follows a case study conducted on an aerospace structure, namely the wing of a Gnat trainer aircraft. The case study considers evidence-based classifiers as an alternative to probabilistic classifiers for the problem of damage location within the context of Structural Health Monitoring.

Although a second-order Monte Carlo simulation is commonly employed for this task, this approach often requires unjustified assumptions which may be inappropriate in some circumstances. We argue that the two kinds of uncertainty should be propagated through mathematical expressions with different calculation methods. Basically, interval analysis should be used to propagate ignorance, and probability theory should be used to propagate variability. We demonstrate how using an inappropriate method can yield erroneous results. We also show how ignorance and variability can be represented simultaneously and manipulated in a coherent analysis that does not confound the two forms of uncertainty and distinguishes what is known from what is assumed.

Two distinctly different approaches using Monte Carlo methods are discussed: (1) the end point is a fixed but unknown value (e.g., the maximally exposed individual, the average individual, or a specific individual) or (2) the end point is an unknown distribution of values (e.g., the variability of exposures among unspecified individuals in the population). In the first case, values are sampled at random from distributions representing various ''degrees of belief'' about the unknown ''fixed'' values of the parameters to produce a distribution of model results. The distribution of model results represents a subjective confidence statement about the true but unknown assessment end point. The important input parameters are those that contribute most to the spread in the distribution of the model results. In the second case, Monte Carlo calculations are performed in two dimensions producing numerous alternative representations of the true but unknown distribution. These alternative distributions permit subject confidence statements to be made from two perspectives: (1) for the individual exposure occurring at a specified fractile of the distribution or (2) for the fractile of the distribution associated with a specified level of individual exposure. The relative importance of input parameters will depend on the fractile or exposure level of interest. The quantification of uncertainty for the simulation of a true but unknown distribution of values represents the state-of-the-art in assessment modeling.},

First, a finite parametrization is chosen to model the aleatory uncertainty by choosing a representative approximation to the probability density function conditioned on epistemic variables. The epistemic uncertainty is then propagated through the moment evolution equations of the conditional probability density function. This way we are able to model the ignorance when the knowledge about the system is incomplete. The output of the system is a Dempster-Shafer structure on sets of cumulative distributions which can be combined using different rules of combination and eventually transformed into a singleton cumulative distribution function using Smets' pignistic transformation when decision making is needed.},

  abstract = {Complex mathematical and computational models are used in all areas of society and technology and yet model based science is increasingly contested or refuted, especially when models are applied to controversial themes in domains such as health, the environment or the economy. More stringent standards of proofs are demanded from model-based numbers, especially when these numbers represent potential financial losses, threats to human health or the state of the environment. Quantitative sensitivity analysis is generally agreed to be one such standard. Mathematical models are good at mapping assumptions into inferences. A modeller makes assumptions about laws pertaining to the system, about its status and a plethora of other, often arcane, system variables and internal model settings. To what extent can we rely on the model-based inference when most of these assumptions are fraught with uncertainties? Global Sensitivity Analysis offers an accessible treatment of such problems via quantitative sensitivity analysis, beginning with the first principles and guiding the reader through the full range of recommended practices with a rich set of solved exercises. The text explains the motivation for sensitivity analysis, reviews the required statistical concepts, and provides a guide to potential applications. The book: Provides a self-contained treatment of the subject, allowing readers to learn and practice global sensitivity analysis without further materials. Presents ways to frame the analysis, interpret its results, and avoid potential pitfalls. Features numerous exercises and solved problems to help illustrate the applications. Is authored by leading sensitivity analysis practitioners, combining a range of disciplinary backgrounds. Postgraduate students and practitioners in a wide range of subjects, including statistics, mathematics, engineering, physics, chemistry, environmental sciences, biology, toxicology, actuarial sciences, and econometrics will find much of use here. This book will prove equally valuable to engineers working on risk analysis and to financial analysts concerned with pricing and hedging. © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {The ISO "Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement" (GUM) establishes a unified method for evaluating and stating measurement uncertainties that has been accepted by nearly all calibration services and most test co-operations in all parts of the world. In measurements of mechanical quantities, such as acceleration and derived motion quantities, the application of the GUM may be difficult and very time-consuming unless some possibilities of simplification are made use of. After a brief introduction to the basic procedure specified in the GUM for the calculation of the measurement uncertainty, a survey of the problems typically encountered in uncertainty calculations when, for example, vibrations are measured or accelerometers calibrated by laser interferometry is given. It is shown how a model function of simple structure can be established for the usually complex relationship between the output quantity (e.g. sensitivity of an accelerometer), the quantity to be measured (e.g. acceleration) and various influence quantities (noise, transverse motion, base strain, etc.). Among other things, non-linear effects such as the influences of distortion, hum and noise can be properly taken into account. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Background: The aim of the Guide to Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) is to harmonize the different practices for estimating and reporting uncertainty of measurement. Although there are dear advantages in having a common approach for evaluating uncertainty, application of the GUM approach to chemistry measurements is not straightforward. In the above commentary, Krouwer suggests that the GUM approach should not be applied to diagnostic assays, because (a) the quality of diagnostic assays is to low, and (b) the GUM uncertainty intervals are too narrow to predict the outliers that occasionally trouble these methods. Methods: Some of the examples presented by Krouwer are reviewed. Sodium measurements are modeled mathematically to illustrate the GUM approach to uncertainty. A standardized uncertainty evaluation process is presented. Results: Modeling of sodium measurements demonstrates how the GUM uncertainty interval reflects the treatment of a bias: The width of the uncertainty interval varied depending on whether a correction for a calibrator lot bias was applied, but in both cases it was consistent with the distribution of measurement results. Expanding the uncertainty interval to include outliers runs counter to the definition of uncertainty. Used appropriately, the GUM uncertainty can be helpful in detecting outliers. In standardizing the uncertainty evaluation, the importance of the analytical imprecision and traceability was emphasized. It is problematic that manufacturers of commercial assays rarely inform about the uncertainty of the values assigned to the calibrators. As demonstrated by an example, external quality-assurance data may be used to estimate this uncertainty. Conclusions: The GUM uncertainty should be applied to measurements in laboratory medicine because it may actually support the forces that drive the work on improving the quality of measurement procedures. However, it is important that the GUM approach is made more manageable by standardizing the uncertainty evaluation procedure as much as possible. It is essential to focus on the traceability and uncertainty of calibrators and reagents supplied by manufacturers of assays. Information about uncertainty is necessary in the evaluation of the uncertainty associated with manufacturers' measurement procedures, and in general it may force manufacturers to increase their efforts in improving the metrologic and analytical quality of their products.
