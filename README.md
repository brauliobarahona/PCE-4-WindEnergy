Polynomial Chaos Expansions for Wind Energy
-------------------------------------------


This project develops different application of Polynomial Chaos Expansions for wind energy. Current applications are:

- **WT-AEP-and-EFL**: Wind turbine power, thrust coefficient and equivalent fatigue loads PCE surrogate based on HAWC2 simulations.
